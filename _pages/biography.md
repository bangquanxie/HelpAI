I am currently an assistant professor, research fellow, and Ph.D. supervisor of advanced engineering college at Great Bay University, China（助理教授、研究员（正高）、博导）. My laboratory is called HelpAI Lab, focusing on the Embodied AI for Autonomous Driving and Robot. I was a joint training Ph.D. of South China University of Technology, China, and Clemson University, USA. And I was a Postdoctoral researcher of Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, USA. 

My research interests include Autonomous Driving and Robot, Embodied AI, Machine Vision, Multi-modal Fusion & State Estimation, Attention Mechanism & Transformers, AutoML & NAS, Large Model Semi-Supervised Learning, Model Compression and Distillation.

I am recruiting [Ph.D.](https://www.gbu.edu.cn/detail/article/731)/Master (The joint training supervisor is an European Academy of Sciences Fellow 欧洲科学院院士), PostDoc(more than 50W/year, 与[清华大学](https://www.gbu.edu.cn/detail/article/931) / [中科大](https://www.gbu.edu.cn/detail/article/768)联培博后A、B岗, 清华/中科大出站证书), [Assistant Researcher and Research Assistant](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/2k_y3IRTaR1ctjoBeMkWEQ) (PhD or excellent master candidates，特任研究员分A、B岗，研究助理可以远程), Visiting Scholar/Students（Providing accommodation，可以远程）, to join my research laboratory HelpAI Lab. HelpAI Lab will customize a research guidance team, including off campus experts, for each student with a research topic. The off campus experts come from Apple, Google, Lucid Motors, BMW, CU-ICAR, ERAU, CMU, etc. Please email me with your CV and research plan for prospective collaborators(bangquanxie@gbu.edu.cn).
